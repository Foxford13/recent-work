# My example work

## Description

Here are some examples of the code I did for SAMlabs. For security and copyright reasons I could not include the rest of the API and its scripts.

API was done in node.js using GaphQL, Apollo-express, and Prisma. All was test-driven, using Jest framework, and written in Typescript.

The idea behind this project was to either create or update users in bulk, from csv file, so they could have tags assigned to them for ease of filtering.
The 'scripts' code made a call to an API from a local machine, and the API processed it accordingly.
From the API I only included relevant code to the tags feature.
